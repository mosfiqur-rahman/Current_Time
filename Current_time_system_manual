PROGRAM : Current_time.cpp
PURPOSE : It will convert the time[military format] in Philadelphia to the local times in different
          cities of the world, like- Honolulu, Seattle, London, Moscow, and so on.
          For this reason, it will take the time in Philadelphia,
	      as an input, and will show the same time in other cities as
          the output calculating the desired result.

This program is created to convert the time[military format] in Philadelphia to the local times in different cities, such as- Honolulu, Seattle, London, Moscow, HongKong, and Aukland. 

After running the program, the program will take the time[military format] in Philadelphia as an input, and will store it in a int type variable named current_time_philadelphia. Then, the program will convert the time into the local time, and will store the new times in different int type variables named time_now_honolulu, time_now_seattle, time_now_london, time_now_moscow, time_now_hongkong, time_now_aukland. 


The program will use the following algorithms to convert the times as the time difference is given in the problem. 

        time_now_honolulu = (current_time_philadelphia+1800) % 2400;
	time_now_seattle = (current_time_philadelphia+2100) % 2400;
	time_now_london = (current_time_philadelphia+500) % 2400;
	time_now_moscow = (current_time_philadelphia+800) % 2400;
	time_now_hongkong = (current_time_philadelphia+1200) % 2400;
	time_now_aukland = (current_time_philadelphia+1700) % 2400;

After that, the program will show the user, his/her desired output i.e. the Philadelphia time, converted into the local time of other cities.


Note:- The program is made using the formatting directives in the iomanip library.
